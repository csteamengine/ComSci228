# ComSci228

This repository is in violation of this course's syllabus:

    Tendering information: In a university environment (such as in this course), if you make your assignment
    available for someone else to copy, you are guilty of tendering information, which is also
    considered to be a form of academic dishonesty.

    ...

    There is one exception to the above rules: code may be shared after it can no longer be turned in for credit
    (i.e., after the late deadline â€” normally 24 hours after the deadline, counting weekends and holidays)


The code in this repository was [pushed](https://github.com/csteamengine?tab=activity) before the late deadline passed, which is in violation of the academic dishonesty code.

Cease and Desist.
